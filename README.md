# Setup Guide
1. Confirm you have Python installed, this can be checked by running `python3` in your console.
2. Run the program for the first time: `python3 run.py` <br>This will bootup the project. 
3. Populate the `media` directory with all of the photos and videos you would like to use. You can now generate playlists, and view them in `playlist_loaded`.
<br><em>(Your media player will need the ability to autoplay videos and do photo slideshow for the respective media)</em>
# Use Case
We've all had that extremely specific situation in life:

- You have a gigantic external hard drive of wallpapers, but the holidays are just around the corner, and you're particularly excited about showing your workplace enthusiasm for National Burrito Day. :burrito:
- You're a resurgent Vaporwave DJ with your comeback show coming up, but you don't have time to spin up the ambient visuals of empty malls and 2003 QVC recordings. 
- You work in an open-concept office with team dashboard monitors, and you hijacked the system to instead put on a slideshow album of your Silver Arowana farm. 

There's just so many situations where you need to have some random playlist of media. This makes things a little easier for you. Just provide the media you'd like to use, and then you can generate playlists on the fly! If there's one you particularly liked, you can re-load it for use!
